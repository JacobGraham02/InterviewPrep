General Questions on Triggers and Functions (Total marks 20)

Question 1: What is a definition of a trigger?(2 marks) 

A MySQL trigger is a stored program, with queries, that is executed automatically in response to a specific event performed on a table.
Examples being BEFORE or AFTER INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE clauses on tables

Question 2:  What are the 2 types of triggers?(2 marks)

SQL trigger and external trigger

Question 3:  Each type of trigger can be activated / fired in 3 ways.  What are the 3 ways to activate a trigger? (3 marks)

BEFORE, AFTER, INSTEAD OF

Question 4:  Name 2 benefits of using triggers? ( 3 marks )

Alternative way to run scheduled tasks, because they are invoked automatically BEFORE or AFTER a change is made to data in a table
They handle errors from the database layer

Question 5:  What are the 2 main differences in using Functions when compared to Stored Procedures? ( 2 marks )

Functions must return a single value, where a stored procedure can return 0, 1, or multiple values
A transaction cannot be used inside a function, while in a stored procedure can be used

Question 6: What is a definition of a user-defined function?( 2 marks)

Routines that accept parameters, perform an action such as a calculation, and returns the result of that calculation
Extending MySQL with a new function that works like a native MySQL function. 

Question 7:  What are the 3 types of user-defined functions? (3 marks)

Scalar-valued
Table-valued
Multi-statement table-valued

Question 8:  Name 2 benefits of using user-defined functions.(2 marks)

Help decompose a large program into small segments which makes a program easier to understand

Question 1 (10 marks)

Create a trigger called SALARY_CHANGE_UPD.   

It is an AFTER UPDATE TRIGGER on the SALARY COLUMN OF THE EMPLOYEE TABLE.   
Compare the OLD salary record with the NEW record to check whether they are different and whether the salary has been increased more than 10%.   
If they are INSERT a record into the following table, which you will have to create :

CREATE TABLE SALARY_CHANGES(EMPNO NUMBER, NEW_SALARY DECIMAL (10,2), OLD_SALARY DECIMAL(10,2), GREATER_THAN_10 BOOLEAN, TIMESTMP DATE);

Question 2 (10 marks)
Create a trigger called PREVENT_UPDATE.   
It is a BEFORE UPDATE TRIGGER on the HIREDATE COLUMN OF THE EMPLOYEE TABLE.   
Compare to see if the old  HIREDATE  with the NEW record to check whether they are different.   
If they are PREVENT the update from happening by creating an error (hint use SIGNAL SQLSTATE).

Question 3 (5 marks)

Question 5 (10 marks )

First : Create a user-defined function (F_CONVERT_TO_EURO)  to do the following:

Convert a Canadian dollar amount to a Euro amount.  You can use the conversion formula 1 CDN Dollar = 0.72 Euros.

The input and output need to be DECIMAL types but you can use whatever size of DECIMAL you want as long as you have 2 decimal places.

    Second :  Create a store procedure (P_STAFF_COSTS_EURO) that selects Name, Department, Salary and Comm from the Staff table.     
    Sum up Salary and Comm for each Name and Department and convert those values to Euro and return records (hint return the select) from the stored procedure.

Question 6 (15 marks )
